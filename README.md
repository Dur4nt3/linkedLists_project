# Linked Lists Project

## Linked Lists - Overview

This is the seventh project of the "JavaScript" course within "The Odin Project".

The main goal of this project is to practice data structures.

In particular, this project aims to implement a linked list data structure in JavaScript.

`linkedLists.js` includes the class for the data structure, and `main.js` showcases it.

## Usage

This project is a CLI-based project (i.e., there is no GUI component), you will need to run this project in the command line via the node CLI utility.

### Prerequisites

To run this project you will need the node CLI utility.

**Note:** If using the node CLI utility, please ensure that the version you are using is at least v22, as this is the version where node can automatically detect ES6 modules (which this project uses) without requiring any further configuration.

### Installation

Clone the repository via:

`git clone https://github.com/Dur4nt3/linkedLists_project.git`

Run the JavaScript file via:

`node main.js`
